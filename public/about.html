        <h2>A Little About Myself</h2>
        <p>
            I'm 38 years old, and currently serving in the USAF as an Air Traffic controller. <br>
            I am a husband and father of 3 boys. I love to laugh and have a good time, but I also <br>
            am very dedicated to my work and improving myself. I am looking to cross over into the <br>
            tech-field as I have always had an interest in computers, and coding in general.
        </p>
