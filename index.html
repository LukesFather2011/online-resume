        <h2><b>Professional Summary</b></h2>
        <p>
            As an experienced Air Traffic Control Training Manager with over 15 years in 
            the United States Air Force, I have honed my leadership skills, managing teams and 
            complex operations under high-stakes conditions. My career in aviation has been marked by 
            a commitment to excellence, from overseeing critical missions and ensuring the safety of 
            multi-million-dollar assets to training the next generation of air traffic controllers.
            Now, I am channeling that same dedication and passion into a new challenge: transitioning to 
            a career in computer science. Through my studies in computer science, web development, and 
            programming with Python and C++, I am building the skills necessary to bridge my expertise in aviation with 
            emerging technologies. I am particularly interested in roles that allow me to contribute to the 
            aviation industry through innovative tech solutions, whether that be in software or web development,
            cybersecurity, or data analysis. Driven by a relentless curiosity and a commitment 
            to continuous learning, I am eager to leverage my unique blend of aviation experience 
            and tech skills to make a meaningful impact in my next role.
